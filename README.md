# Google Calendar Zoom Tools

Hate clicking around just to find the link to join or share to the Zoom meeting your currently apart of? Maybe not, but I do, so I made this.

## Setup
* Python 3.x
* Google Calendar Python API Tools (Step 1 and 2 [here](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python))

## Usage
Your meeting started, but you're too lazy to open your calendar or the Zoom app to join the correct one:
```bash
python zoom_current_join.py
```

You're listening in on a meeting via a Zoom room or someone elses computer, and your boss asks you to share your screen. You don't want to join, show your face, and create a bunch of audio feedback in the room. YOU JUST WANT TO SHARE YOUR SCREEN.
```bash
python zoom_current_share.py
```

This was fun.
